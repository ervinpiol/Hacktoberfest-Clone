    question: "Why isn’t there a Women’s fit t-shirt this year?",
    answers: [
      "This year, we expanded our unisex t-shirt offering to two types: dark and light mode. To print two different types of t-shirt, we had to streamline the process by selecting a single t-shirt style. The t-shirt style we chose for 2022 is a tighter, more tailored fit than the t-shirts of previous years and falls somewhere between a unisex fit and a women’s fit. Would you prefer that we bring back the women’s fit t-shirt option?",
